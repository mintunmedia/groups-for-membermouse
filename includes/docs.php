<h1>Getting Started with Groups</h1>
<p>Welcome to Groups! This plugin allows you to extend your MemberMouse membership site to allow members to purchase Grouped Memberships!</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Add Hidden Field shortcode snippet to your checkout page. Place the following shortcode before the ending [/MM_Form] tag. This field will not appear on your checkout page because it's hidden. Don't worry, it's there and it's doing what it needs to do!<br />
    <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="[MM_Form_Field type='custom-hidden' id='<?= $group_id; ?>']" style="width:400px; background:#fff;">
  </li>
  <li>Add Group Signup Link Shortcode to your Confirmation Page and anywhere else you want to share the Group Sign Up link with your Group Leaders<br />
    <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="[MM_Group_SignUp_Link]" style="width:400px; background:#fff;">
  </li>
  <li>Create Group Types <a href="admin.php?page=groupsformm" target="_blank">here</a>. Group Types are the different types of Groups you may offer. For Example: Gold Group Membership, Silver Group Membership. Group Types are what Group Leaders will purchase.
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left:30px;">
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> Set the name for the Group Type.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Leader Associated Access:</strong> Choose what Membership Level that the Group Leader will have applied to them. Keep in mind that if it's a Paid Membership Level, you'll need to choose the product that they'll purchase to gain access.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Member Associated Access:</strong> Choose what Membership Level the Group's Members will have applied to them. Usually you want this to be a Free Membership level, that way Group Member's don't need to purchase Membership to be a part of the group. However keep in mind, you can also offer Discounted access for Group Member's, if this is what your business calls for.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Size:</strong> Choose how many member's are associated with your group. Group Size <strong>does not</strong> include the Group Leader.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add or Share your checkout page link for Groups by clicking "Purchase Link" next to your group type in Groups for MemberMouse. <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>do not use product links in MemberMouse > Product Settings. They will not include the correct parameters to create a Group when purchased.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Group Leader Management Dashboard</h2>
<p>Shortcode: <input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="[MM_Group_Leader_Dashboard]" style="width:400px; background:#fff;"><br />Add the front-end Group Leader Dashboard to any page with this shortcode! This dashboard allows your Group Leaders to add members, delete members, grab their group sign up link and see all the members in their group.</p>

<h2>Other Thoughts</h2>
<p>We recommend you create products only used for Group purchasing. That way there's no confusion as to what people are buying in reporting and in usage. This also allows you to use [MM_Order_Decision] tags on your Confirmation Page that way your Group Sign Up link is only seen by Group Leaders. We also recommend putting this shortcode into an input field. This will require some an extra development step (which we'll be implementing in a future release of Groups)<br /><br />
  <strong>Example:</strong><br />
<pre>
[MM_Order_Decision productId='5']
<input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="[MM_Group_SignUp_Link]" />
[/MM_Order_Decision]
</pre>
</p>
<p><strong>Here's the Code Snippet You'll Need to Add to functions.php:</strong><br />
<pre>
add_filter( 'wp_kses_allowed_html', function ( $allowedposttags, $context ) {
  if ( $context == 'post' ) {
    $allowedposttags['input']['value'] = 1;
  }
  return $allowedposttags;
}, 10, 2 );
</pre>
</p>
